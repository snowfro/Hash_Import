# Hash_Import
Blockhash-based Visual Art Project

9/10/17
Added the spacebar feature! Press the spacebar when you see an image that you like and a full scale vector image will be saved as pdf into the "screenshots" folder. The name of the file is saved with the hash string of the generated image. If the "screenshots" folder is not present, it will be created in the directory of the sketch. 

Hash strings are internally generated at the moment.
